# GPT Financial Services

## Introduction
This is my final project for my CS 4990 class. It's a website with a Bootstrap front-end, jQuery to ping the backend, and a Python Flask server for the backend.

## Problem Statement
One of the issues that GPT 3.5/4 faces is having safeguards for financial advice.
Typically, if one asks for specific stock recommendations (such as what to purchase) GPT 
will not respond. This project aims to remove said restrictions to ask deeper and more 
complex financial questions.

## Implementation Details
By giving GPT a list of strict requirements, and manipulating the CONTEXT IN A UPPERCASE FORMAT.
This acts as an 'override' allowing the developer to set/remove barriers!
